        <h2>Introduction to Armadillos</h2>
        <p>Armadillos are New World placental mammals with a leathery armour
          shell. The Chlamyphoridae and Dasypodidae are the only surviving
          families in the order, which is part of the superorder Xenarthra,
          along with the anteaters and sloths. The word armadillo means
          "little armoured one" in Spanish.</p>

          <p>About nine extant genera and 21 extant species of armadillo have been
          described, some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on
          their armour. Their average length is about 75 cm (30 in), including
          tail. All species are native to the Americas, where they inhabit a
          variety of different environments.</p>

          <p>Recent genetic research suggests that an extinct group of giant
          armoured mammals, the glyptodonts, should be included within the
          lineage of armadillos, having diverged some 35 million years ago,
          much more recently than previously assumed.</p>
